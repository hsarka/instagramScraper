Hello, world! It’s time for a sweet and prickly dose of #WeeklyFluff. Mr. Pokee (@mr.pokee) is a 3-year-old hedgehog who hails from Germany, but he’s quite the world traveler. “He loves to explore everything for the first time,” says Mr. Pokee’s human, Litha. “He runs around the place and enjoys all the new smells — his nose is really good.” Check out today’s story to see shots from Mr. Pokee’s travels."

Inspired by her love of everything from cute, colorful dolls to horror movies, 19-year-old makeup artist June Noel (@visiblejune) creates makeup looks to express her dual nature. “I love pink, but I also love black!” says June, who’s been doing makeup for five years. “Through makeup, I can express my love for both rather contradicting sides. That’s why I love it so much. I’ve learned that I don’t have to choose one side. I can have both. I hope that people get inspired to express themselves through makeup, in any style or way that’s meaningful to them.” Watch June create one of her makeup looks today on our story and on our IGTV channel.

15-year old Tati McQuay has been creating her own dance moves since she could stand on two feet. But recently the Los Angeles-based dancer and actress has become interested in Latin-influenced dance. “As I get older, I’ve been learning and loving my Latin roots so much more,” she says. “Listening to Latin music is my newest thing!” Whether in her dance or in her everyday life, Tati’s motto is to stay true to herself. “There’s no point trying to be someone you are not because people will see right through it,” she says. “Stick to your roots and be true to you.”
This month, we’ll be sharing the stories of Hispanic-American community members in celebration of #HispanicHeritageMonth, which runs through October 15 in the US. Today on our story: Tati shows us her dance moves. 💃 #MiVoz #MyVoice"	"5609"	"760566"

Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPperspective
This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos from a different point of view, as in this featured photo by Mao May (@maomay__). Here are some tips to get you started:
Capture a familiar subject or scene from an unexpected angle. Get up close and let a face cover the entire frame, or make a puppy look large by shooting from ground-level as she stares down. Find a high vantage point to show the wider context of a festival scene or bustling market.
Use geometry to your advantage. Look for graphic lines — in bridges or telephone wires — that converge to a vanishing point in your composition. Find a new way to capture patterns in everyday places, like the wheels of bicycles lined up in a rack, or symmetrical bricks in an unruly garden.
Play an eye trick. Defy gravity with simple editing, like rotating the frame. Recruit a friend to make a well-timed leap, that, when rotated, looks like they’re flying through air. Or turn a dandelion into a human-size parasol by playing with scale and distance.

PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPperspective hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."

These are the best words 16-year-old surfer Caroline Marks (@caroline_markss) has to describe the feeling of riding the man-made wave — designed by surfer Kelly Slater (@kellyslater) — at #SurfRanchPro, a World Surf League (@wsl) competition this past weekend in central California. “It’s about a 50-second ride,” says Caroline, who surfs for at least four hours a day as part of her training regimen. “You can do about eight turns and then get two barrels. There’s nothing like it.” 🌊
