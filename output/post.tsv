“I’m immediately drawn to people who are pushing up against barriers and boundaries,” says Canadian photographer Sara Hylton (@sarahyltonphoto), whose degree in international conflict and gender studies led her to focus on telling stories of women, conflict and underrepresented voices around the world. “What inspires me the most is seeing people, especially women, thrive in situations or places that the world doesn’t know about or has given up on.” These places and communities include ones close to home — both in her native province of Saskatchewan, and where she currently lives, in Mumbai. 
For Sara, the most magical photos come from portraiture. “I hold my camera at my heart,” she says, “so I’m looking directly at somebody when I’m taking pictures of them. The most inspiring moment is when I feel a connection — when I feel their heart and my heart, and there’s nothing that’s really between us.” ❤️ Today on our story: see some of Sara’s photographs from her work with Mumbai’s hijra, or third gender, community."

The technique behind Oakland, California-based artist Annie Wong’s (@headexplodie) stop-motion artwork is, at heart, basic: mold, shoot, repeat. But a strong aesthetic informs the process, too, lending Annie’s videos a sneaky emotional punch. “I’m really interested in emotional literacy,” she notes — and her work, from GIF stickers to longer pieces, brings that interest vividly to life. 
Drawn to creative endeavors from a young age (“I was definitely known as the arty kid in grade school”), Annie studied photography and painting in college. What she loves about the stop-motion she’s doing now is that it combines many aspects of art making. “There’s painting, building with your hands, lighting, animation — which is like acting — and video editing, which is kind of like filmmaking. It’s where I’ve found my happy place, because I really like playing with all those sorts of materials.” Watch Annie’s “lighthearted interpretation of the cyclical nature of our emotions” on our story and on our IGTV channel.

Weekend Hashtag Project: #WHPmotion
This weekend’s goal is to capture objects and scenes in motion, as in this photo by Elena Shevchuk (@elena_from_tver). Start with the movement. Consider the range of motions you can document that reflect different feelings or emotions, like the quiet and soothing way wind gently blows your friend’s hair, or the high-energy action of your sibling splashing in a pool. 
Plan the capture. The way you document movement can bring another dimension to your #WHPmotion submission. For example, you could blur the action by tracking the motion of a bright car as it drives through a busy junction to create an abstract environment, or you could capture a cat midair as it jumps down from the furniture for a freeze-frame effect.

Play with creative tools. Slow motion or time-lapse can exaggerate the mood and movement in your submission, or multiple exposures can track multiple positions of someone moving through your frame. 
PROJECT RULES: Please add the #WHPmotion hashtag only to photos and videos shared over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video shared over the weekend is eligible to be featured next week."

For Martina Martian (@martinamartian), GIFs aren’t just a form of art, they’re a mood-lifter. “Even the dullest photo or the dullest conversation can be made more fun with a GIF,” says Martina, an artist from Sydney, Australia. When she started creating GIFs two years ago, they were heavily 80s and 90s inspired. “Only through creating every single day did I start to trust my own instincts as an artist and grow into my personal style,” she says.
Martina, who finds inspiration in everything from travel to conversations with friends, says the challenge in creating GIFs is keeping them simple while figuring how your audience is going to interact with them: “GIFs are used as a communication tool as well as something to look at. I like having to consider how someone would use the GIF on their own photos or conversations. It’s about communicating ideas and feelings vividly in just a few seconds.” Starting today, you can use GIFs in your Direct messages. Check out our story to learn more."	"7374"	"523546"
